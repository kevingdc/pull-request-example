# Making Pull Requests

When making pull requests, follow the template included in this repository. Remember to provide an explanation of WHAT you changed and WHY.

If the change is long (i.e. 2 or more files), include a video to explain. You can use [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) to record your videos.

Lastly, add the reviewer using the right sidebar in the pull request page.
